"""Single-master reciprocal ego_planner_driver smoke test.

Two ego nodes (UAV1, UAV2) share one ROS master. Each node publishes its own
trajectory_intent and we wire each node's neighbor_intent to the other node's
trajectory_intent, mirroring how EgoSwarmDriver forwards bridge-received
neighbor intents into the C++ node.

Scenarios:
  A) cross: both UAVs fly in parallel at the same time (reciprocal mutual
     awareness, parallel routes keep the swarm cost from preventing arrival).
  B) stagger: UAV2 starts after UAV1 (neighbor intent stale/epoch handling).

Assertions:
  - each node receives the other's neighbor_intent (count > 0)
  - both nodes reach EXECUTING then COMPLETED (arrival is verifiable in the
    parallel scenario)
  - relative-axis conversion works: C++ replan receives msg.stamp and converts
    to local axis at replan time (verified indirectly by successful replan)
